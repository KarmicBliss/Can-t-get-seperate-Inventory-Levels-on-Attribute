# Can-t-get-seperate-Inventory-Levels-on-Attribute
I have Classes that I sell on Dates  The Dtaes are atributes and they all need an Inventory level  eg 16 people
Then as the urchases come in ddraw down on the positions
Everytime I set up an inventory leve for one it does them all
I have Inventory at Product level Trned off
I have Manage at Variation turned on
